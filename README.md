# MFTau_App
Project made for MF Tau community and for my BSc paper.

This is second version of the app, made with mostly added features in Android, with interfaces made in Jetpack Compose (previous version written in xml is available in "xml" branch).

In the future it will be turned to Compose Multiplatform app (as soon, as the Compose Multiplatform stable release will be available on iOS).
